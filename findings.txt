Summarise your findings here (see specification).

To identify which was the hardest of the grids I added a function to
count the calls to the solveboard function, this is outputed above the
solved grids.


Mystery1.dat - grid is the extremely hard grid since using my
program there is 421547 calls to the solve_board funciton. 

Mystery2.dat - grid is unsolvable, receive a solution cannot be found.

mystery3.dat - grid is hard, the program solves the problem, however
the calls to the solve_board function is 25667, significantly fewer
that mystery1.dat.
